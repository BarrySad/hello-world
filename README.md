# hello-world

A brief description of who I am and my experience with programming.

I am a 21 year old college student pursuing a degree in cybersecurity with a concentration in ethical hacking. The main programming language I have the most experience with would definitely be Python. I am an avid Linux user, and I love ArchLinux. I have a lot of experience with hacking and using the tools found in Kali Linux, as well as creating and obfuscating payloads.
