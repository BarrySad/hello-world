# hello-world

A brief description of who I am and my experience with programming.

I am a 22 year old college student pursuing a degree in cybersecurity and network penetration testing. 
I have a decent amount of experience with Python, and I have experience using the exploitation, intel gathering, post exploitation, and vulnerability analysis tools found in The PenTesters Framework (PTF) by trustedsec.
